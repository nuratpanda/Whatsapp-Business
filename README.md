# Whatsapp-Business
The Project recommends local business around you using WhatsApp.
The idea is to help you access the phone numbers and adresses of local business around you using whatsapp. For example if you need to find the nearest barbing salon, all you need is go to whatsapp and type in barbing salon and it gets the numbers and addresses of barbing salon around you.
Details of hoew the project was done goes below;

We obtained people's number on whatsapp and the name of their businesses

Secondly, we built a recomenders system to suggest the nearest businesses with the contact we obtained from whatsapp

Lastly, we built a user interface using streamlit to make it more interactable.

I attached the code for the recommenders system, the streamlit code and also a video on how it works.

NOTE: It is still under production so it might not work well.

Feedbacks and suggestions are highly welcome. You can contact me at labakebusiness4@gmail.com
